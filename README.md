# David Sogno Website

David Sogno is a portfolio website designed to allow visitors to view the artist's work, see information about each artwork (including price, dimensions, etc.), and contact the artist to receive more info and/or make a purchase.

This was the final project for Generation USA's Java Full Stack Developer program.
